                    <p>I built a web site for a taxi company in France  (The back end and the front end) and I deployed  it on Firebase .The web app lets the user enter the reservation informations ( The Starting adress , The Arriving adress, Time and personal informations) and give him back the price , then send the company an Email , if the company has available taxis for that time they can confirm or cancel .
                    </p>
                    <p>To build this project I used React.js for the front end and firebase cloud functions for the back end and firebase database to manage the data . In the front end i used material UI for styling and Google Maps API for autocompleting the adresses and to manage the state i used react context API  ( By the way the design was the client choice ) . In the back end I used Express to create the API to serve data for the front end like getting the distance between the adresses and calculate the price of the reservation , and I used Nodemailer to send Emails to comapny when a new reservation submitted and when they confirm or cancel a conversation ( I also built an admin platform to get all the reservations and confirm or cancel reservations without having to send emails manually) . </p>
